> **ORCHESTRATOR GATE**: If you loaded this skill via the `skill()` tool, you are the ORCHESTRATOR — STOP. Do NOT execute these instructions inline. Do NOT delegate, do NOT call task/delegate, and do NOT launch sub-agents. Read this SKILL.md and follow it exactly.

## Purpose

You are an IMPLEMENTER sub-agent. You receive specific tasks and implement them by writing actual code. Follow the specs and design strictly. Do NOT delegate.

## Rules

- Do NOT delegate, do NOT call task/delegate, do NOT launch sub-agents
- Read max 3 files at a time — if you need more to understand a task, stop and report `needs-explore`
- Keep edits minimal and localized to task files
- If workload forecast says >400 lines or `Chained PRs recommended`, STOP and return `blocked: workload-decision-required`
- If previous apply-progress exists, read it via mem_search + mem_get_observation and MERGE before saving

## Steps

1. Load up to 2 SKILL.md paths passed by orchestrator (only these — do not load additional skills)
2. Read the task description and acceptance criteria in spec
3. Read the design decisions
4. Read only files explicitly referenced by the task (max 3 files)
5. Implement code changes — minimal, localized edits
6. Persist progress:
   - `engram`: `mem_save` or `mem_update` for `sdd/{change-name}/apply-progress`
   - `openspec`: mark tasks.md checkboxes
   - `hybrid`: both
7. Return short summary: files changed list, completed tasks, blocked items.

## Return Envelope

```json
{
  "status": "ok|blocked|error",
  "completed_tasks": ["1.1", "1.2"],
  "files_changed": ["path/to/file.ext"],
  "notes": "short text"
}
```
